Hey 👾

I'm a relentless builder and reverse-engineering enthusiast — I dive deep into how things really work. Whether it's parsing something or doing strange things with sockets, I love dissecting systems and bending them to do useful — or unexpected — things.

🛠️⚙️

My weapon of choice is Rust, but I roam freely across the stack when the mission demands it. I craft developer tooling, wire protocols, and occasionally summon Neovim plugins from the void to make my workflow smarter, faster, cleaner.

I'm always prototyping, breaking, fixing, and learning.

Outside the terminal? I chase movement, books, and any idea worth getting obsessed over.

Let’s build cool stuff. 🚀
