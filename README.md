## Hello 👋

I am a passionate professional who enjoys solving various problems using different tools and theoretical knowledge. I am always working on projects and learning what is necessary to develop them. My primary language is Python, but I work with any technology needed to achieve the desired results.

📚
My programming journey began at the age of 14 with C++, where I developed some projects to learn, and since then, I have incorporated a wide variety of languages and technologies, including Python, JavaScript, Lua, Django, NodeJS, Astro, TailwindCSS, and ReactJS.

🕵🏽‍♂️🔍
I work on backend development and enjot with data-related projects and specialize in integrations and dynamic insights from them, with a focus on applied engineering. Additionally, I am developing a scientific researching on predictive traffic analysis in Antofagasta, based on Waze data, which aims to optimize road safety through predictive models. The project is deployed at the following link: [Antofagasta Traffic Dashboard](https://traficoantofagasta.com).

👨🏽‍🔧👨🏽‍💻
On a personal level, I am working on data engineering projects, an area I am passionate about.


I LOVE WORK ON NEOVIM AND IMPLEMENT NEW FEATURES FOR MY WORKFLOW.
