## Hello 👋

I am a passionate professional who enjoys solving various problems using different tools and theoretical knowledge. I am always working on projects and learning what is necessary to develop them. My primary language is Python and Rust, but I work with any technology needed to achieve the desired results.

I work on backend development and enjoy with data-related projects and specialize in integrations and dynamic insights from them, with a focus on applied engineering. Additionally, I am developing a scientific researching on predictive traffic analysis in Antofagasta, based on Waze data, which aims to optimize road safety through predictive models. The project is deployed at the following link: [Antofagasta Traffic Dashboard](https://traficoantofagasta.com).
